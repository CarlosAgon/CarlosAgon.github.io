### [Musical orchestration](/projects-orchestration/)
Orchestration is the subtle art of mixing instrumental properties. Among all techniques of musical composition, it has always remained an empirical activity. Our approach is intended to search for sound combinations within instrument sample databases that best match a target timbre defined by the composer. We propose an original approach for the discovery of relevant sound combinations, in which we explicitly address combinatorial issues and tackle the problem of temporal descriptors evolution.
